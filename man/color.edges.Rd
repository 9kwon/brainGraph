\title{Color graph edges}
\usage{
color.edges(g, comm, lobes = NULL, cols = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{g}{The graph to get its edges colored}

\item{comm}{An integer vector indicating community membership}

\item{lobes}{An integer vector of the lobe membership for each vertex}

\item{cols}{A character vector of the colors each vertex group should take}
}
\value{
A character vector of colors for each edge in the graph
}
\description{
This function takes the community membership of a given graph, and assigns
to the edges a specific color (the same as the vertex membership colors).
Currently only works for up to 9 communities (colored: red, green, blue,
yellow, magenta, orange, lightgreen, lightblue, lightyellow). Edges that
connect two different communities are colored gray. Also works for the major
lobes of the brain (plus insula).
