# brainGraph
*brainGraph* is an R package that is used to perform graph theory analyses of
brain MRI data. It is currently most useful in ROI-based analyses (e.g. using an
atlas such as AAL or one from Freesurfer); however, the computations will still
work with any graph. There is a rudimentary plotting GUI that will *not* work
without data from a standard atlas (to be fixed some time in the future, but 
it wouldn't make too much sense for non-brain MRI data).

# Installation
If you do not have the *devtools* package, I recommend you install that first.
Then, all you need to type is
``` r
devtools::install_github('cwatson/brainGraph')
```
This should install all of the dependencies needed along with the package
itself.

# Usage
Stay tuned for the addition of the *brainGraph* User Guide.
