Title: Graph Theory Analysis of Brain MRI Data
Author: Christopher G. Watson <cgwatson@bu.edu>
Maintainer: Christopher G. Watson <cgwatson@bu.edu>
Description: 'brainGraph' contains functions that perform graph theory analyses
    of brain MRI data. It is best suited to data from a Freesurfer analysis (for
    now), but can work with more. If using data from a Freesurfer atlas, there
    are also functions for graph visualization (rudimentary).
