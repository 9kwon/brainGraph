Title: Graph theory analysis of brain MRI data
Author: Chris Watson <cgwatson@bu.edu>
Maintainer: Chris Watson <cgwatson@bu.edu>
Description: brainGraph is a set of functions that performs graph theory
    analyses of brain MRI data. It is best suited to data from a
    Freesurfer analysis (for now), but can work with more. If using data from a
    Freesurfer atlas, there are also functions for graph visualization
    (rudimentary).
