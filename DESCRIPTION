Title: Graph theory analysis of brain MRI data
Author: Chris Watson <cgwatson@bu.edu>
Maintainer: Chris Watson <cgwatson@bu.edu>
Description: brainGraph is a set of functions that performs graph theory
    analyses of cortical thickness data. It is best suited to data from a
    Freesurfer analysis, but can work with more. If using data from a Freesurfer
    atlas, there are also functions for graph visualization (rudimentary).
Depends:
    R (>= 3.0.0),
    igraph,
