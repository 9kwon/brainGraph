Coding-related
    * Think more about data structures


* Graph theory calculations/measures/etc.
    * Maybe do something to do w/ motifs?
    * See if there are other measures from the BCT that I want to do
    * Start thinking about extending to weighted/directed networks


* Get indices based on major lobes, do stuff w/ that
    e.g. parietal.nodes <- c(4, 7, ...)

* Do permutation testing (or proper bootstrapping) for whatever makes sense
    (global measures)
    e.g. get transitivity from 10,000 random graphs
        get modularity
            avg. path length
            sigma
            betweenness (if it makes sense)
            EV cent (if it makes sense)
            global efficiency
            rich club coeff
