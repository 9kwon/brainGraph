# brainGraph
*brainGraph* is a package that is used to perform graph theory analyses of brain
MRI data. It is currently most useful in ROI-based analyses (e.g. using an atlas
such as AAL or one from Freesurfer); however, the computations will still work.
There is a rudimentary plotting GUI that will *not* work without data from a
standard atlas (to be fixed some time in the future).
